# Weather-Dashboard

## Purpose
To create an application to show the current weather of a city as well as its five day forecast. This application runs in the browser at this [link](https://mrxanthic.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/) and allows the user to type in a city and populate the current and future weather conditions of that city, including the temperature, wind speed, humidity and UV index. The UV index will be colored green if it is in a safe range (0-2), yellow for moderate conditions (3-7), and red for severe UV conditions (8+). The app also saves the local search of history of cities searched and will pull up the weather conditions if that city is clicked in the search history bank.
